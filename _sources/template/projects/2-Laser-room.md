## Laser Room

### Brief Description
<!--The BLU (Bristol Laser Ultrasound) Team tackles the challenges associated with remote non-destructive evaluation, where the transmission and the reception of ultrasonic signals are achieved using lasers. The non-contact, couplant-free nauture of laser ultrasound enables inspection in hazardous environment (high temperature, radioactive), and the flexibility of laser scanning allows the inspection of complex geometries. This is a collaborative project with University of Strathclyde.-->

The laser room is set up for the laser ultrasound non-destructive evaluation technique, which is contactless and couplant-free compared to conventional PZT ultrasonic transducers. There are a generation laser (Class 4) and a detection laser (Class 3R) in the room. The lasers are mounted on motorised stages to achieve optical scanning.

### Laser safety

Both the Class 4 and Class 3R lasers can cause safety issues such as eye damage. The laser safety training can be found here.
The risk assessment can be found [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/grp-UNDTGroup/Shared%20Documents/Risk%20Assessments/09RA%20laser%20ultrasound.docx?d=w565f2730f1bc46bba4e0d65b18df26db&csf=1&web=1&e=3OcIsV). Please sign in the hard copy of the rish assessment in the lab.
Safety goggles, etc.
